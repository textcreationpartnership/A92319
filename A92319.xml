            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arriage is an image of heaven, for the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtate is compared to eſpouſals: <hi>This myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is great, Epheſ. 5.32.</hi> becauſe union of hearts in wedlock doth much reſemble the glorious uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then you have had in this kind the heaven upon earth, as much as Marriage can afford it you; for the dear, and entire, mutual and reciprocal love which paſſed between you and your noble Bridegroom was ſo eminent, that it ſeemed not onely to be affection, but paſſion: it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to admiration, and it might be preſented to the world for imitation. But all earthly comforts have their stints and limits. <hi>They that rejoyce muſt be as if they rejoyced not, 1 Cor. 7.30.</hi> There is nothing here ſo tranſcendent, but it is tranſitory; the ſweeteſt fruit doth corrupt, the brightest gemms do loſe their luſtre; that which doth moſt delight us doth leave us with an heart-gripe, we muſt turn away our eyes from our moſt enamouring objects with a ſtorm of tears. So hath it happened to Your Honour; He which lay neareſt to Your heart it taken out of Your boſom, and the want of him hath cauſed You to be a true mourner. Thus heavenly providence doth order all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our temporary comforts; he will have nothing here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, that we might rely upon him which is unchangeable: it is not the wedding-ring that can endow any with laſting felicity, conſtant joy is not to be found in the Bride-bed; they are not our embraces that can keep faſt our deſired delights, nor our eager
<pb facs="tcp:119330:3"/>eyes that can fix a face long for us to look upon: No, death doth pluck many a dear pledge out of our hands, and extinguiſh many a lamp when it is ſhining before us with the greateſt brightneſs: This moth doth fret in pieces our coſtlieſt robes, this thunderbolt doth cleave aſunder our moſt admired monuments; there is no armour of proof againſt this dart; when this blow is given, ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine chains break; when death doth give the knock there is no keeping within doors, when death doth come with the ground-spade, who muſt not be buried under ground? we had need not to fancy any thing too much, for the beſt is but a periſhing delight; we had need to provide ſomething that is immortal, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that we do here enjoy is mortall. The wiſeſt head at laſt will be but a deaths-skull, and the kindeſt husband, we may at laſt take him up in an handful of duſt, or go lye by him in a bed of clay. Death doth but ſmile when we do call any thing here our own, and deride us that we laugh in that face which with a ſtroke can be made pale and griſly. Your Honour therefore hath done well to furniſh Your ſelf with that which might comfort You beyond Nature, and give You engagements when all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of Nature do fail: and indeed. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable to all things, and hath the promiſes of this life and of that which is to come, 1 Tim. 4.8.</hi> theſe are <hi>the great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, 2 Pet. 1.4.</hi> How would You have done if You had had nothing above this world to ſtrengthen You againſt this trial? You did but a little (if You remember) leave Your ſelf to Your ſelf, and Your footſteps were well nigh gone; You did but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Your Husband to be dead when he was not dead, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Natures ſad apprehenſions, what a ſad fit did it bring upon You? Your own life was in danger: but You no ſooner left con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with fleſh and bloud, and began to take up Religion to be Your director, but You were able with more patience and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, moderation and Chriſtian ſubmiſſion, to undergo what God in his high and over-ruling wiſdom ſhould appoint and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: You could then speak to the honour of God, and conform to the will of God, ſaying, Why ſhould You try maſteries with God, when You knew that <hi>A ſparrow doth not fall to the ground but by Gods appointment?</hi> So that (noble Lady) there is no light like to a beam of Gods Spirit, nor no counſellor like to a
<pb facs="tcp:119330:3"/>ſanctified heart: all the Preachers upon earth, all the Angels of heaven can hardly ſo well informe us as our own regenerate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. They which fear not God fear all things; they which have learned God are taught againſt all exigents; therefore <hi>the fear of the Lord is the treaſure, Eſ. 33.6. I know that it ſhall be well with them that fear the Lord, and do reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, Eccleſ. 8.13.</hi> Natural perfections are a ſcant and fickle livelyhood, therefore the Saints fee-ſimple is free-grace; then have we ſomething to rejoyce in and rely upon, when he in heaven, <hi>according to his godly power, hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godlineſs, 2 Pet. 1.3.</hi> This is the ſtock that is to be preferred before Rubies, yea of greater value than all the treaſures of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The Carbuncle of high birth is nothing like to the jewel of new-birth; all Academical Arts are nothing like to the eye-ſalve of the Spirit. <hi>There is a ſpirit in man, but the inſpiration of the Almighty giveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Job 32.8. Here is the mind which hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Rev. 17.9.</hi> The moſt ſolid judgment is that where there is <hi>a quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord, Eſ. 11.3. Through Chriſt I can do all things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; but without Chriſt we can do nothing, or very little. <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth:</hi> There is not ſuch a <hi>faint-heart</hi> as an unregenerate perſon, <hi>he doth flee when none doth purſue,</hi> the leaſt trial doth cauſe in him <hi>aſtoniſhment of heart;</hi> yea, <hi>the ſound of a ſhaken leaf doth chaſe him, Lev. 26.37.</hi> he is <hi>like a ſilly Dove without heart, Hoſ. 7.11.</hi> We ſee it in <hi>Haman,</hi> who wanted nothing for outward pomp and potency, and yet the leaſt check of neglect doth make all that he was worth a burthen, yea a very loathing to him, for, <hi>What doth all this availe me?</hi> And the like is to be ſeen in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> who had greatneſs enough, and puſillanimity, daſtardlineſſe enough, for being croſſed he is quite confounded, his Counſel being but deſpiſed; he doth defie himſelf, and in an impatient humour doth eaſe his troubled heart with an halter: So that a meer worldling doth ſink under all trials: But is a Saint no more magnanimous? yes, ſuch an one can bear more weight then the ſhoulders of <hi>Sampſon</hi> the puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; There is the invincible Spirit and the invulnerable breſt. There is not ſuch an Heroe upon Earth as a gracious Creature.

How can this thing be? <hi>by Gods power being made perfect through weakneſs, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>12.9.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf, <hi>when I am weak then am I ſtrong,</hi> v. <hi>10.</hi> no Chymist can draw out ſuch an Elixar; no, it is the ſecret of regeneration or the miracle of grace. And is it not (noble Lady) grace that hath perfected and preſerved you in your trial? yes, nature made you look downward, and grace made you look upward; nature made you to ſtagger, and grace did ſtabliſh you; nature ſet you on weeping, and grace dried the tears on your cheeks; nature made you look mournfully on your dying and dead Lord, and grace made you patiently reſign him up to your God. Grace is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venew, remedy and refuge in all extremities; preſerve your grace, and you are fitted for all future caſualties, and that I truſt ſhall never fail you; for as I know few of your Sex which do excell you in wiſdom, ſo do I know none Superiour to you in grace. <hi>Gracious Lady, wait upon your gracious God, and he doth offer yet more grace,</hi> James <hi>4.6. Yea, he is able to make all grace to abound towards you, that you having all-ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>9.8. for there is the unſearchable riches of his grace,</hi> Eph. <hi>2.7.</hi> Well, be wanting in no grace, that you may count it your spiritual ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; and ſay with the bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>by the grace of God I am what I am; not I, but the grace of God which is with me, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>15.10. ſeems to be created to the praiſe of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his grace, that you may be accepted in the beloved,</hi> Eph. <hi>1.6. value this life no further then to have the grace of life, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>3.7. have grace whereby you may ſerve God accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with Reverence and Godly fear, 12</hi> Heb. <hi>28.

I confeſs this is a very ſad affliction, eſpecially to quench ſo much love in a breſt, when the heart was in a burning flame; and were it not for Gods irreſiſtible will and your own Chiſtian obedience to his divine pleaſure, I ſhould not know how to ſettle your ſpirit, but you ſee from what hand the chaſtiſement came; therefore, <hi>hear the rod and who hath appointed it,</hi> Mich. <hi>6.9. you know whom you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> fix your heart upon that God, humbly yielding to the ſtroke, and in that <hi>God of recompences</hi> you may find this loſſe repaired, and perhaps a double bleſſing for this preſent ſad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

His li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Image you much delighted in; my deſire is, that you might ſtill have a ſight of him in this dead picture. For want of time it was but half drawn in the Pulpit, I now preſent it to you as I had penſilled it out by my ſelf; ſtretch out your honourable hand to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the piece, and bear with the mean Artiſt.

Every good man <hi>amici caſum gemit, doth lament the death of ſuch a Country-Splendour;</hi> the loſſe of ſuch a valuable Cedar is even unvaluable; wiſh that thou hadſt his eminencies, wiſh that thou hadſt fallen in his ſtead; many a firre-tree might be ſpared in reſpect of ſuch a Cedar. But ſeeing it pleaſed the Lord of the forreſt that he ſhould no longer grow, look with a ſad eye upon the breach, the rent, the torn flagge, the deep hole he hath made at his fall. Oh that ſo many trees about him ſhould never enjoy his preſence again! that ſo many eyes which beheld this Cedar in his glory ſhould never be ſo happy as to behold him in his height again! but ſeeing there is no remedy, but this <hi>Cedar</hi> muſt be taken away, call him <hi>Cedar,</hi> and beſtow a volly of grones at his fall. I do not wiſh thee to fall with him; no, long maiſt thou grow upon thy ſtock and ſtemm; but if it be poſſible let thy top bow down, thy bark cleave, a little ſap drop out of thy rind at his fall; if any firre-trees have any ſenſe in them, let them looſen their pith at ſuch an accident; if they have any ſpeech in them let them howl. <hi>Howle firre-tree, for the Cedar is fallen.</hi>

Is this the Peace-offering, the Sacrifice of praiſe, which thou doſt offer for magnifying mercies, for bands of love, for the goodwill of him that dwels in the buſh, for the candle of the Lord ſhining upon thy head, for ſilver wings, &amp; feathers of gold, for a lot fallen unto thee in a good place, for waters of a full cup, for waſhing thy ſteps in but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for proſperity that hath riſen as the flood, for riding upon the high places of the earth, for excellency that mounts up to the Heavens, for an horn exalted like the horn of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn, for making thy neſt as the Eagle, for living as in <hi>Eden</hi> the garden of God, where every precious ſtone hath been thy covering, for being ſatisfied with favour, and being full of the bleſſing of God, for a hill of bleſſings, for ſhowers of bleſſings, for bleſſings poured out of the windowes of heaven in ſuch an abundance that there is ſcarce room to receive them? will not all theſe <hi>ſpokeſmen</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thy ears make thee know thy God? will not the beams of ſuch a radiant favour make thee to ſee thy God? doth <hi>God</hi> heap benefits upon thee, &amp; canſt not diſcern a hand of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? are there ſo many bleſſings ſinging in thy eares, and yet canſt not hear the ſounding of his bowels? when ſhall God ſpeak to thy heart? when ſhall he ſend tokens enough unto thee to make thee acknowledge him Friend? he hath made thee great, but when wilt thou aſcribe greatneſſe to him? thou haſt had the fruit of his mercies, when ſhall he have the fruit of thy lips? wilt never make him Prince? nor exhibit to him his true glory who hath ſet thee amongſt Princes, and made thee inherit the throne of glory? haſt been brought up thus long in the ſchoole of bounty, and canſt not learn the leſſon of thankfulneſs? hath God blown up ſuch a bright flame of proſperity for thee, and will not a ſparke of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude fly from thee? read over all thy patents, free deeds, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Courtrolls, Commiſſions, look upon thy porches, fanes,

Well, they are the beſt Antiquaries that can tell the meaning, and fulfil the meaning of this National Adage. For are the mighty of the Land onely to ſhew their might and riches in preſerving what is left them, or in purchaſing in new Lordſhips and Royalties? no, this is ſelf-thrifty nobleneſſe; and I could name a great number of theſe Horſe-leeches in the Nation, of the greateſt rank and degree, which worſhip no other Deities but their Houſhold-Gods, which keep their hands within their boſoms, and have conjured their Eſtates within
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119330:12"/>a circle, which know no Countrey but their coffers, nor no Common-wealth but their private wealth; which are poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and yet not political; of the Nation, and yet not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall; great Pole-cats, high-flown Kites, honourable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, noble Niggards; as gripple, and inhoſpital, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>national as ever was <hi>Laban, Nabal, Timon, Telemachus, Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Calenus, Patroclus, Fabullus, Labullus,</hi> or any other which have been noted of ſordid and tenacious ſpirits. Now are theſe Cedars? are they uſeful for the general good? the general! no, ye are too general for them, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their particular pouch; if they build, they build onely like Ravens, a neſt for their own lumps, and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds, a goodly Manſion for Father-flint and his progeny; but not a Dormant, Pillar, Joyce, Stud or Tenon will theſe ſpare for the publick; therefore had as good a Bramble grow in the Forreſt as ſuch Cedars. But ought true Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men to keep all their Timber within their own bark? no, they ſhould ſerve to repair the breaches of the Land, and to build up the old waſte places, <hi>Moſes, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, Zorobabel,</hi> the Ruler in the Goſpel, <hi>Alcibiades, Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Pericles, Porſena, Probus, Telegoras, Pompey</hi> the Great, <hi>Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, Horatius Cocles, Valerius Publicola,</hi> all which have been renowned for famous Patriots, have done thus.

               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, if they be fragrant; for as a Cedar doth give a ſweet ſent, ſo a kind of fragrancy ſhould come from a true Nobleman, his ſmell ſhould be like the ſmell of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> Hoſ. 14.7. But how ſhould this fragrancy be expreſſed? To God, the King, the People.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, to God; in purity of faith; for errour in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is a bone out of joynt, a glaucome in the eye, an impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume or calenture in the brain; all Religion without an uncorrupt faith is a blazing Comet; ſuch a man <hi>is ſubverted,</hi> Tit. 3.10. <hi>He hath in him the myſtery of iniquity,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.7. <hi>The root of bitterneſſe,</hi> 12 Heb. 15. <hi>The Doctrine of Devils,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:119330:13"/>1 Tim. 4.1. he hath (as <hi>Jeremias</hi> ſaith) <hi>broken in pieces Gods image, and ſet up a Foxes in ſtead of it.</hi> How neceſſary is it then that <hi>mens minds ſhould not be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2.

Away with all <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clites</hi> in Religion, and <hi>Hermaphrodites</hi> in the Church. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour gives an ill ſent afar off, it is truth onely like the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> which doth yield the fragrant ſavour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, to a King in Loyalty, Loyalty I ſay, and not contumacy. What is left to the beſt of the people but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection? <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man, whether to the King as ſupreme. Be ſubject to principalities and powers. Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers. Fear God and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King. The Fathers children muſt bow down before him that holdeth the ſcepter.</hi> Where then is there the leaſt ground for oppoſing Princes? they which ſay they are the Kings beſt ſubjects, muſt not onely help him into the Throne, but they muſt not diſturb him in his Throne; if they draw not a ſword till Scripture give them authority, I never look to ſee a pitch'd field fought againſt a Prince; for the Word of God will not ſuffer a ſword to be unſheathed againſt a lawful Sovereign. <hi>Doſt thou abhor Idols, and yet commit ſacrilege?</hi> ſo, doſt thou defie <hi>Popery,</hi> and yet take the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Priming-powder? I like never an Article nor Particle of that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bluſh to think, that they which ſeem to be as great enemies to it as my ſelf, yet have fought battle after battle againſt their gracious King, as faſt as any Romiſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique could: O, rebellion, I doubt, is worſe Popery than ſcrupled Ceremonies: I tremble at it the more becauſe I find <hi>Solomon</hi> threatning <hi>ſudden deſtruction againſt it,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul damnation.</hi> If it were but a matter of gallantry it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, yet <hi>Joab's</hi> an <hi>Abner's</hi> Men playing this game was but mad ſport, there was <hi>bitterneſs in the later end;</hi> but when it comes to the loſs of a ſoul, and ends in damnation, this is horrour: let all them which are true Proteſtants beware of this luſty, bloudy, damning Popery. But what need I trouble my ſelf about this needleſs fear? though this were once an unhappy errour, yet it ſhall never be renewed: the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119330:13"/>Times are pacified, mens judgments more enlightned, their actions reformed, and their hearts ſetled in firm Loyalty; nothing but the peace of the Kingdom ſhall be ſtudied, and ſubjection to ſupreme Authority practiſed, no King ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer a broken nights reſt by a Proteſtant; a Proteſtant will take an Oath of abjuration againſt rebellion, as well as againſt the other erroneous opinions of Popery; whatſoever turbulencies, commotions and treaſons may be in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, yet amongſt us there ſhall be ſeen nothing but the peaceable, obedient, and King-preſerving Proteſtant: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, do it, for it is for the honour of thy profeſſion, thy conformity to Gods Laws, the inviolableneſs of thy Oath, the welfare of the Nation, and the bliſs of thy ſoul.

               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, to the people in Patience, Juſtice and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, in Patience: <hi>It is the honour of a man to paſs by an offence,</hi> it is but the humour of a man to be revenged on an offence: <hi>The wiſdom which doth deſcend from above is gentle, peaceable, and eaſie to be intreated;</hi> but the wiſdom which doth deſcend from beneath is furious, ſpightful, and never to be intreated; and an implacable man is the incendiary of the Countrey, and the fiend of the Age. Is this to imitate <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who patiently endured <hi>Shimei's</hi> reproches? or <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:119330:14"/>who forgave his malicious brethren? or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>pende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat &amp; petebat,</hi> hung upon the Croſs, and yet prayed for his enemies?<note place="margin">Aug.</note> no, it is to imitate <hi>Cain, Eſau, Saul, Haman,</hi> and the Devil himſelf, who is the envious. Should we then for every diſtaſte require <hi>an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth?</hi> no, we that owe ten thouſand talents, had not need pluck our brethren by the throat for a few pence: <hi>Forgive thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and thou haſt given him a deadly wound.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Secondly, in Juſtice: Let beaſts live by prey, but a true noble heart doth ſcorn to live by ſpoils; he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he doth poſſeſs juſt, unleſs it hath been weighed out unto him by the ſtandard. He is ready to ſay with that noble Judge, <hi>Nolo denarium malè intrantem,</hi> I will not have a penny come over my threſhold the wrong way: the ſighs of his neighbours, the grones of his tenants, and the cryes of the poor are as terrible unto him as thunder; therefore he doth meaſure out all his actions by equity. Violence hath a bad ſent, but Juſtice is a very ſweet ſavour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, in Charity: Where God hath not ſpared bounty, it is ill for that man to ſpare more than is fit. A true Nobleman is the Almoner of his Countrey, he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count hoſpitality his honour; he doth think that his whole eſtate is but a Leaſe of Gods free favour, and therefore he doth pay his rent ſtrictly; he doth ſuppoſe that he is not a Nobleman, unleſs he be a charitable man. <hi>If the clouds be full they will pour out rain:</hi> He dare not hide his eyes from his own fleſh, the poor is brought up with him as with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He doth think he can never ſay his prayers well, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he doth liſten to the cries of the poor; <hi>for he that ſtoppeth his ears againſt the cryes of the poor, ſhall cry himſelf and not be heard.</hi> He doth think that he cannot juſtly beg his <hi>dayly bread,</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119330:15"/>this: what is the reaſon? can any of you eſcape death? have any of you a writ of privilege to be freed from death? no, death hath you in her black roll, and every one of you ſhall be called forth in order: O therefore have an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, and a preparation for death, or elſe I ſhall ſay that there is a great deal of Knowledge, but little Vertue; a great deal of Profeſſion, but little Conſcience. Tell not me of your skill in the Metaphyſicks, get skill in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, this ſame ſtate of Nature; be well verſed in generation and corruption: I ſhall conclude that ye are ſome Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and addicted to familiar Spirits, and much given to Necromancy, if your knowledge of death do not teach you to dye, but onely to tell tales or death, and to propheſie of accidents in this world; they that ſtudy the Black Art do thus, and I doubt ye do little better. Would to God I could draw you, with the Magicians, to burn your books of curious Arts, and to turn this book of the Expiring art, the large Treatiſe of Corruption; as ſmall a book as ye do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it, I tell you it is more voluminous than the <hi>Pandects,</hi> or than all the <hi>Codes.</hi> To ſtudy this book well it will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the beſt wit to the height; ye will find more <hi>Aenigma's</hi> and <hi>Poſtula's</hi> in it, than in the Mathematicks; yea, more difficulties in it than in learning all the Eaſtern Languages: A crafty politician, for all his Mercurial brain, will be Lard put to it to unfold this State-riddle; a Doctor of the chair may be poſed in this intricate book. I tell you it hath ſo many branches in it, and is ſo copious in Canons and Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms, and Aphoriſms, that it may be called the book in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, or the Library of the world, or a general Hiſtory, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Ephemerides: It doth diſcourſe of all things from the Artique to the Antartique Pole, from the Creation to the later day of Judgment, it doth contain the ſtate of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

Free your ſelves from this, and I will ſay that ye have more wit then the cunning Secretary, the crafty Judge, wily Gaol-keeper, and the politick Fanatick; but I ſee death ready to apprehend you, condemn you, and lead you forth to execution; what therefore have ye any wet eyes? ye will elſe ere long have dry eyes. Do ye bend your knees? if not, ye ſhall bend them lower; have ye held up your hands for mercy? if not, ye ſhall not have an hand to ſtir; have ye found the plague of your own hearts? if not, ye will die with the deadly marke upon you; have ye ſtilled the cries of the poor? have ye made ſatisfaction for your minglings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteratings, falſe-weights, ſlippery bargaines, uſuries, perjuries, ſpoiles, ſpights? if not, they will meet you at Gods judgement-ſeat.

               <p>But why did the Prophet call upon the Firre-tree to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fall of the Cedar? could he not have called upon the ſhrubs, or myrtles, or thorn-trees, to lament the loſs of a Cedar? no, theſe had ill ſap in them, or a rough bark, and ſo fruitleſs and uſeleſs many of them, that they were fit for nothing but the fire; therefore he doth reject theſe, and apply himſelf to the <hi>firre-tree:</hi> For the <hi>firre-tree</hi> is a moſt beautiful tree, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, and purely white, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called by ſome <hi>Gallica;</hi> it is full of delightfull ſtrakes within, and admirable for beams, and to bear the weight of buildings, and both the <hi>pars ſapina &amp; fuſterna</hi> (as Authors call them) are of rare uſe for ſeveral employments: <hi>Cato</hi> would have his curious Preſſes made of them, and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> next to the Cedar, doth call to <hi>Hiram</hi> for the Firre-tree to build his Temple with, as ye may ſee in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.8. &amp; 10.

The Firre-tree then was the fitteſt judge of the worth of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, and well choſen out by the Prophet, as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tree to lament the fall of the Cedar. <hi>Firre-tree, the Cedar is fallen.</hi> From hence then further obſerve, <hi>That they muſt be men of prime affections which muſt be ſelected to priſe the perfections of others.</hi> Deſert will want its honour if worthleſs men paſs ſentence upon it: <hi>what need have 1 of madmen?</hi> ſo what have we of low-gifted, or bad and baſe-minded men? <hi>Sus Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam?</hi> ſhall the injudicious or profligate ſet out the fame of meriting men? no, <hi>what taſte is there in the white of an eggs? the heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi> Vertue will never have due commendation from the contemptible. <hi>Wiſdom is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of her children.</hi>

                  </gap>. To let paſs then the Cedar for his height, and to come to his properties. Had he not in him every thing that is requiſite for a Cedar? yes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt, was he not ſmooth? who can call him a knotty tree? no, <hi>Quo non alter amabilior,</hi> as it was ſaid of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, <hi>then whom there was none more friendly,</hi> I may ſay of him as <hi>Agiſtrata</hi> ſaid of <hi>Agis, nimia tua bonitas, nimia manſuetudo, thy courteſie might ſeem too great, thy mildneſſe too great,</hi> the very Idea of humanity and gemme of affability; it did appear to all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, where there was the neareſt conjunction; I mean betwixt him and his honourable Lady: Were there ever Eſpouſals with more inviolable affection? was the yoke of Wed-lock ever worn with more delight? <hi>was not he to her the covering of her eyes?</hi> Gen. 20.16, <hi>was not ſhe to him the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſire of his eyes?</hi> Ezech. 24.16.<note place="margin">Eadem erat illis mens &amp; ſimil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limi affe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> may I not ſay of them as <hi>Ludovicus</hi> ſaith of his Father and Mother, <hi>that there was ever between them the ſame mind and the ſame affections,</hi> as if they had been born under one Conſtellation, or had but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two faces and one will? Match me ſuch noble paires, which ſpent out ſo many years in dear and reciprocal affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, for his ſervants; was there ever a great Lord that treated ſervants with more gentleneſſe? no, they lived with him rather as with a <hi>Father</hi> then a <hi>Lord,</hi> or as with a <hi>Friend</hi> then a <hi>Maſter;</hi> under ſome others, ſervants might be called as they were in <hi>Lacedemonia, Helot, ſlaves,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:119330:26"/>but under him they might be called as they were in <hi>Creet, Chryſonetae,</hi> the golden ſervants; he preferred many, loved all; now where was there more freedom and freeneſs?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, for his neighbours, was he not moſt affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? yes, another <hi>Adrian</hi> the great Emperour, who was as <hi>Dion</hi> ſaith, <hi>humilimorum amicus,</hi> a friend to the moſt humble; ſo was he a companion to the meaneſt, a Lord amongſt Lords, but familiar amongſt his neighbours; yea, he had rather loſe his life than his humanity, as the ſame <hi>Adrian</hi> ſaid, when her was taxed for uſing too much civility (as they thought) towards his Inferiours. I never remember any which knew better how to reſerve ſtate and preſerve friendſhip, to be both a Lord and a neighbour together. His courtefie then is evident, a great heart that carried in it a moſt heroick ſpirit, and yet was the ſoft boſome of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Was he not uſeful? yes, what did he ſtudy more than the good of the Common-wealth? one of a moſt publick ſpirit, he honoured his Countrey as his Mother, as <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> adviſed his ſcholars; and he was not onely born in a Famous Countrey, but he was <hi>dignus patriâ</hi> worthy of his Countrey, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid of a friend: how many good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and noble favours could I reckon up to confirme this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, was he not fragrant? yes,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, for his faith: as he was well-gifted, ſo he was well-principled; he had a ſingular judgment and a ſincere heart, apprehenſive and ſteddy; that whereas ſome travel into far Countries to bring home an outlandiſh faith as well as outlandiſh manners, which think they are never witty enough till they be skilled in the Magick of Religion: he, though he had been amongſt the Inchanters, yet would he learn none of their ſorceries. Few Noblemen had been in more European Countries than he himſelf, and there where the <hi>Crafts-maſters</hi> dwelt, yet none of theſe could corrupt him or ſeduce him, he returning home a true Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: when his Mother-Church had given him his grounds, he hated that a Step-mother ſhould be his new Miſtriſs: he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119330:26"/>ever hated errour and novelty, and was ſound both in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and diſcipline: It is true, the jewel was his own, yet he came often hither to have it filed; for as he ſtored the Church with the ableſt men he could find, ſo he was a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent frequenter of the Sanctuary, and a reverent hearer; and thoſe which he found to be intelligent and invariable, he both countenanced and honoured them: that as it was ſaid of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> that he was <hi>pater Senatus, &amp; pater omnium bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi> The father of the Senate, and the father of all good men: ſo he was the Patrone of Orthodox Doctrine and Orthodox Teachers. And as he lived ſo he dyed; for a little before his departure he made a ſolemne profeſſion of his faith, and then ſaid that he died a profeſt adverſary to all Romiſh doctrine, and a true Son of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> according to the 39. Articles. And thus ye find him fragrant concerning his faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, was he not fragrant towards his <hi>King?</hi> yes, name me a more loyal Peer. He was <hi>lapis quadratus, a ſquared ſone;</hi> neither Sequeſtrations, nor Impriſonments,<note place="margin">Baſil.</note> Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, Taxations or Decimations could make him fickle or falſe; he had rather have been ſick of any diſeaſe, then have had the Leproſie of diſloyalty to have appeared in his forehead. He was (as it were) one of the ſtedfaſt Angels which remained firm, when Lucifer and his train rebelled. His fidelity in this kind was ſo eminent, that it was Gods high mercy that it did not once coſt him his life at home; and it drew him when he got free often to hazard his life abroad; and when he returned, how was his Eſtate drained, till it almoſt fell into an Epilepſie? So then for his Loyalty, he is come to his grave with this honour, that he lived and died an unblemiſhed and an unſtained Royaliſt, fragrant he was to his Prince.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, was he not fragrant towards his neighbours? yes,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, in patience; I hope there is not here or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, the moſt impatient or pacified man that can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him to have been an irefull man. It is true, he had an high magnanimity of ſpirit to defend his juſt Rights and Royalties, but for common injuries he regarded them
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119330:27"/>no more then Northern blaſts;<note place="margin">Suidat.</note> he did not with the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſet up a ſpear to run that man to the heart which had injured him, or offered him an abuſe. But when he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked divers times to compell ſatisfaction for high af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and contemptſ, he thought it was beyond his Religion and his nobleneſſe to right himſelf for every trivial diſtaſt; <hi>no dart would ſtick in this water:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Telum in aqua non remanet. <hi>Chryſoſt</hi> Non m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m ni me percuſſum.</note> yea when he had been highly irritated, he was ready to ſay with the Philoſopher, <hi>I do not remember that I was ſtricken.</hi> He had learned that of <hi>Solomon, ſay not I will do to him as he hath done to me, and that of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>why do ye not rather ſuffer wrong?</hi> who of his degree and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity lived more peaceably amongſt his neighbours? or had a more relenting heart? or troubled the Age leſſe with vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſuits?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, was he not fragrant in his Juſtice? yes, he might be ſet up for the Standard. The Lamb can as ſoon bite as he could gripe or oppreſſe; another <hi>Pericles,</hi> that never cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any man to go in a ſad garment for his rapines. He might have ſaid with <hi>Samuel, whoſe oxe have I taken? whoſe aſſe have I taken? or to whom have I done any wrong?</hi> bring me that man that can ſay truly, that he hath a Tenement belonging to him that he hath gotten by the wreſt; or one furrow of Land in his whole Eſtate which doth cry out againſt: him for injuſtice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, was he not fragrant in Charity? yes, Town and Country can teſtifie that odoriferous ſent. His houſe was a kind of Hoſpital, a Store-houſe to haile and ſick; his White Wood-ſtacks and his black pots can never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Thoſe which came, went not away empty; and thoſe which did not come, he would ſeek them out and relieve them; his heart was the poores Guardian, and his hand was their Treaſurer: He had troops of poor attended upon him, as it was ſaid of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, a German Emperour; and whereſoever he met them, either in ſtreets, high-waies, or fields, his ſympathiſing ſpirit melted towards them, and his communicating hand dropped bounty to them; thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way his fragrancy was felt. A right Cedar he was in all reſpects, and though he be fallen, yet as the forreſt will
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119330:27"/>want him, ſo it ſhould not ſee him caſt to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an heart-ſtroke, a lip-roar, yea a paſſionate howling. <hi>Howl Firee-tree for the Cedar is fallen.</hi> But ſaith one, when you have magnified your <hi>Cedar</hi> to the height, I ſee a ſpot in him; doſt thou? ſo did he in himſelf, and I hope that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance hath prevented thy cenſure, and his remorſe thy ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor. To me, to others he often lamented his errours; and with fervent prayers and bitter tears begged pardon at the hands of God Almighty. And is God reconciled to him, and wilt thou be inexorable? But what was his ſpot? haſt not thou the ſame? haſt not thou more? haſt not thou worſe? He was no Perſecutor, he was no Traitor, he was no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizer, he was no Hypocrite. There are many ſpots, and the Leper may be apt to cry out of anothers foul skin. It is good for every one to ſttitch up his own rents, before he do complain of a ſeam-rent place in anothers garment, or to waſh his own face clean before he do find fault with a ſpray in anothers checks. <hi>Who can ſay my heart is clean? I am clean from ſin? in many things we offend all. If thou Lord ſhouldſt be extreme to mark what is done amiſſe, who is able to ſtand?</hi> But let his ſpot be what it will, I truſt he hath prayed it away, and we have prayed it away, that by the vertue of his tears and his friends tears (for God was reconciled to <hi>Jobs</hi> friends for his prayers and ſacrifices) or howſoever by the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Gods Covenant, and efficacy of Chriſts blood it is rinſed away. To give thee all the aſſurance that by the judgement of Charity is requiſite, that be died a true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Conſider what I am now to propound unto thee. A little before his departure like a man that had his deaths ſtroke in his boſom, and a yearning for divine favour in his conſcience; he fought for nothing but mercy, and thirſted for nothing but reconciliation: he abounded in tears, was frequent in ſupplications, forced himſelf beyond his ſtrength to the prayers of the family, had often the prayers of divers Church-men in his Chamber, and would lift up his hands devoutly at thoſe things which moved him: he wanted no Counſel, and embraced Counſel, delighted to have the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble read to him, even eight Chapters at a time; he called
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119330:28"/>for mercy whilſt he had freedom of ſpeech; and when for four dayes together he lay in a manner ſpeechleſſe, yet God gave him liberty to utter theſe words, <hi>Lord, Lord, have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Lord, Lord, have mercy;</hi> and theſe were the onely words it that long ſpace which came from him diſtinctly to the hour of his death; God taught him (I truſt) the language with which he ſhould breathe out his laſt gaſp, or God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (which is very likely) ſpake for him. But if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhed tear, nor uttered prayer, the tears and prayer of his friends if there be any power in Chriſtian interceſſion) I hope have beaten out a way to Heaven for him; for his friends were ſeldom without watery eyes, &amp; we were ſeldom off from our knees; ſo that God I truſt hath received our prayers, and received his ſoul; he went like <hi>Elias</hi> with a whirl-wind and a fiery Chariot into Heaven. Come on then ye <hi>Firre-trees,</hi> will ye ſuffer ſuch a Cedar to be carried off from the ground without a forreſt-claſhing, and beating your tops one againſt another? no, let the wilding-tree, the aſpe-tree, the ſloe-tree the beech-tree and wicl — ree be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent if they will, but let all the Firre-trees joyn together in a generall mourning for when ſhall we ſee his equall? when ſhall we behold his Superiour? do ye bury him with thrilling ſpirits and torn hearts; make all the wood to ring, and rend, and roar at his fall; yea, do ye break out into an abſolute <hi>howling. Howle Firre-tree, the Cedar is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi> Well, ſince he is fallen, let us leave him to the Lord Paramount of the Forreſt, onely let his Memory be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and his fragrancy ſweet in our noſtrills; let us for a farewell to him, call him the <hi>Mirrour of worth, and the Monument of honour:</hi> Let us hope that God hath but taken him away, becauſe he hath uſe of ſome Cedar above for his own building; and that he that planted him hath diſpoſed of him for the honour of his own Court; yea, that he ſent ſpecial Meſſengers, even the bleſſed Angels, to carry him from hence upon their ſhoulders, and to lay him within the Court-gate, to be made a Pillar in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: There lie thou, thou noble Cedar, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to thy everlaſting honour and bliſſe. Onely he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119330:28"/>gone, God give us grace to think on our own fall, that we that howl for his fall, may not howl at or after our own fall, but fall with comfort, and be carried away at laſt to the building of God, <hi>an houſe not made with hands, but eternall in the Heavens.</hi>
